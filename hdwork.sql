We\'ve made it as easy as possible for you to upload your job and get the tender underway - and it\'s free!</p><p> </p><h3>How many photos should I upload?</h3><p>Photos are valuable for the tenderers pricing the work. Upload enough photos to clearly show all facets of the job, the surrounding environment, access points and sensitive areas (eg. your favourite tree which you don\'t want cut down). Note that we limit the size of the photos to a maximum of 2Mb each; you may need to lower the resolution of your camera to ensure the photos are below this limit.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to upload a sketch or plan?</h3><p>This depends entirely on the job. A tender for a job to clean a building would normally not require a sketch or plan. A tender for a tree removal would be made clearer with a sketch showing where the cut branches are to be stacked. A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work. A video is valuable to communicate to the tenderers the scale of the project, describe some of the aspects of the project that are difficult to communicate in words and provide an idea of the surrounding environment. Ensure video file sizes are kept to a minimum to assist with upload and download speeds.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to include contract documents when I set up the tender?</h3><p>This depends on the level of complexity of the project and the value of the work. If the tender is to paint a fence then contract documents would be unlikely to be needed; the contract would be based on the detail provided in the description, the photos provided, the price and any other details provided in the Question and Answers. If the tender is to build a house then it would be usual to include a full package of documents with the tender, such as drawings, specifications, terms of payment, conditions etc.</p><p> </p><h3>What information do I need to provide when I submit my price?</h3><p>This depends on what the purchaser requires. As a minimum you will need to submit a price only. Other information that may be required by the purchaser includes clarifications and notes, schedule of prices, sketches/designs and other documents as required by the purchaser. Note that when you submit the tender you are required to confirm that you have read and understood all the information provided by the purchaser.</p><p> </p><h3>What if the price submitted differs from the schedule of prices (if submitted)?</h3><p>The total price submitted takes precedence over the schedule of prices. The purchaser and seller will have to negotiate changes to the schedule of prices so that it matches the total price.</p><p> </p><h3>When I assess the tenders do I need to accept the lowest price?</h3><p>If the tender is a simple one with no terms and conditions then you are to use your own judgement to assess which tender provides the best fit for the services you require. If the tender is more complex, with conditions of tendering as part of the tender docmentation, you are bound to assess the tenders according to the conditions of tendering.</p><p> </p><h3>What protection does Honest Day\'s Work offer buyers?</h3><p>Honest Day\'s Work provides a service to connect buyers with sellers. The buyer and seller to agree on the terms of the contract, the price and the timeframe. When the tender process is complete and the contract has been awarded Honest Day\'s Work involvement in the process is complete and the completion of the contract is then between the buyer and the seller.</p><p> </p><h3>What if circumstances out of my control, such as the weather, mean the contract is delayed?</h3><p>Each scenario will be different; it is up to the parties to consider if the circumstances are covered in the conditions of contract (if part of the contract), or if not if the circumstances represent a fair and reasonable reason for delay. If the parties can not come to an agreement then the Small Claims tribunal is an option for resolution.</p><p> </p><h3>I want to ask a tender question that contains commercially sensitive information - should I do this.</h3><p>You can ask commercially sensitive questions; if the purchaser thinks it is appropriate they will make the question and answer only viewable to you. If you are concerned that the information is highly sensitive then it is best not to disclose it.</p><p> </p><h3>What if you disagree with feedback that has been submitted against your account?</h3><p>In the case of feedback being given which you disagree with Honest Day\'s work will assess the nature of the feedback provided by both parties and make a decision regarding weather the feedback is warranted or should be modified/removed. We undertake to make a fair and consistent decision on feedback; if either party remains unhappy we can review the facts and reconsider our decision. Where disagreement remains between the buyer and the seller it may be appropriate for the parties to take the dispute to the small claims tribunal.</p><p> </p><h3>What is the difference between and Open Tender and a Closed Tender?</h3><p>An open tender is one that is visible to all users and for which tenders can be submitted by all users. A closed tender is one where the purchaser invites specific users to price the work. Invited tenders are suitable for work that is highly specialised and the potential tenderers are well known, or for work where the purchasers experience/knowledge determines that the best value for money and quality is only provided through certain tenderers. A closed tender will not appear on searches.</p><p> </p><h3>How do I pay for setting up or submitting a tender?</h3><p>There are two options. PayPal accepts all major credit cards. POLI is a system where you can log into your bank with the Honest Day\'s Work environment and make a direct debit payment. Both of these systems are secure. We do not retain credit card details; the payments are handled entirely by PayPal and POLI. POLI supports direct debits with the following banks ANZ, ASB, BankDirect, Bank of New Zealand, Kiwibank, TSB Bank and Westpac and is used by other large organisations such as NZTA, Bunnings and the Wharehouse.

If you are preparing a tender, read the information below. If you are submitting a tender, click <a title=\"Resources for Submitting Tenders\" href=\"[sitetree_link,id=17]\">here</a>.</p><p> </p><p>When preparing tender documentation it is important to understand the level of risk you are comfortable with. For example if you are setting up a tender for the construction of a fence, and you believe the cost is around $1,000, you may be comfortable with specifying all your requirements through photos, a sketch and a description of the work. If a dispute arose around some aspect of the work then this could be dealt with by negotiation or in the Small Claims Tribunal and the cost at stake may be manageable.</p><p> </p><p>If the tender being set up was for the construction of a house then the level of risk would be significantly higher and it would be necessary to have drawings and tender documentation prepared to ensure both parties understood what was required, when payments would be made, what would happen if the work was delayed etc. The investment in time/cost to prepare the documents would be worthwhile considering the risk being managed.</p><p> </p><p>Below are templates and guidance on common aspects of tendering. If you are not sure if you need these documents or not it is always best to consult a professional.</p><p> </p><h2>Drawings/Sketches</h2><p>A simple job such as a fence may just require a sketch showing the location, length, height, foundations etc. Larger jobs will often require pages of detailed drawings showing precise measurements and critical features of the work.</p><p> </p><h2>Conditions of Tendering</h2><p>Conditions of Tendering describe the rules of the tendering and tender assessment process. This ensures that both Tenderers and the Client understand what information needs to be provided with the Tender and the process the Client will go through to assess and award the contract.</p><p> </p><h2>Standard Conditions</h2><p>Standard Conditions is a document which sets out the rules and method of managing a contract. Common standards used in New Zealand are:</p><p>· <a title=\"NZS 3910:2013\" href=\"https://shop.standards.govt.nz/catalog/3910%3A2013%28NZS%29/view\">NZS 3910:2013</a> - Construction (link is to the scope only)</p><p>· <a title=\"NZS 3916:2013\" href=\"https://shop.standards.govt.nz/catalog/3916%3A2013%28NZS%29/view?client=html5\">NZS 3916:2013</a> - Design and Construct (link is to the scope only)</p><p>· <a title=\"NZS 3917:2013\" href=\"https://shop.standards.govt.nz/catalog/3917%3A2013%28NZS%29/view\">NZS 3917:2013</a> - Fixed Term (link is to the scope only)</p><p>Other standards are also available.</p><p> </p><h2>Special Conditions</h2><p>Special conditions modify the standard conditions so that the conditions better suit the needs/complexities of your own project. The special conditions are drafted up on a case by case basis.</p><p> </p><h2>Estimate</h2><p>For some jobs, particularly large and complex work, it is helpful to provide an estimate for the Tenderers. Normally this is prepared by an Engineer or someone who has a good understanding of the work. This will help the Tenderers quickly gauge the scope of the work and your expectations around the cost.</p><p> </p><h2>Schedule of Prices</h2><p>A schedule of prices is a breakdown of the price structure line by line. It provides the Tenderers with a format for breaking down their price which makes it easy to compare particular items between Tenders submitted. Once the job is awarded the schedule then provides a means of recording and claiming costs as the work is progressively completed. Essential for complex jobs.</p><p> </p><h2>Terms/Basis of Payment</h2><p>Terms of Payment (or Basis of Payment), describes how and when payments will be made. This is important for work which may span several months, is high risk or has more than one or two elements. Usually the Terms of Payment will refer directly to the schedule of prices and describe how each line item will be paid.</p><p> </p><h2>Specification</h2><p>A specification is a written document which describes the requirements of the work. This could be a short document for simple work or a larger document for more complex work. Normally it would contain sections which align with the schedule of prices and the drawings. Often the specification will refer to well known standards, ensuring the work is completed to best practice. Essential for complex work.</p><p> </p><h2>Extra Reading</h2><p>The New Zealand government have rules for government agency procurement and tendering. While these may be a lot to read through and more onerous than what is required for your job, they do contain some good principals that will help you understand the process.

The client may not select the lowest price if it is evident that that tenderer did not understand critical elements of the job. Use the forum in the tender to ask the client questions about the job, particularly if you can see risks or it is evident the client is unsure about the job.</p><p> </p><p>Each tender will require different supporting information, check well in advance of the tender close date what is required to be submitted and ensure you have enough time to prepare the documentation.

We\'ve made it as easy as possible for you to upload your job and get the tender underway - and it\'s free!</p><p> </p><h3>How many photos should I upload?</h3><p>Photos are valuable for the tenderers pricing the work. Upload enough photos to clearly show all facets of the job, the surrounding environment, access points and sensitive areas (eg. your favourite tree which you don\'t want cut down). Note that we limit the size of the photos to a maximum of 2Mb each; you may need to lower the resolution of your camera to ensure the photos are below this limit.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to upload a sketch or plan?</h3><p>This depends entirely on the job. A tender for a job to clean a building would normally not require a sketch or plan. A tender for a tree removal would be made clearer with a sketch showing where the cut branches are to be stacked. A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work. A video is valuable to communicate to the tenderers the scale of the project, describe some of the aspects of the project that are difficult to communicate in words and provide an idea of the surrounding environment. Ensure video file sizes are kept to a minimum to assist with upload and download speeds.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to include contract documents when I set up the tender?</h3><p>This depends on the level of complexity of the project and the value of the work. If the tender is to paint a fence then contract documents would be unlikely to be needed; the contract would be based on the detail provided in the description, the photos provided, the price and any other details provided in the Question and Answers. If the tender is to build a house then it would be usual to include a full package of documents with the tender, such as drawings, specifications, terms of payment, conditions etc.</p><p> </p><h3>What information do I need to provide when I submit my price?</h3><p>This depends on what the purchaser requires. As a minimum you will need to submit a price only. Other information that may be required by the purchaser includes clarifications and notes, schedule of prices, sketches/designs and other documents as required by the purchaser. Note that when you submit the tender you are required to confirm that you have read and understood all the information provided by the purchaser.</p><p> </p><h3>What if the price submitted differs from the schedule of prices (if submitted)?</h3><p>The total price submitted takes precedence over the schedule of prices. The purchaser and seller will have to negotiate changes to the schedule of prices so that it matches the total price.</p><p> </p><h3>When I assess the tenders do I need to accept the lowest price?</h3><p>If the tender is a simple one with no terms and conditions then you are to use your own judgement to assess which tender provides the best fit for the services you require. If the tender is more complex, with conditions of tendering as part of the tender docmentation, you are bound to assess the tenders according to the conditions of tendering.</p><p> </p><h3>What protection does Honest Day\'s Work offer buyers?</h3><p>Honest Day\'s Work provides a service to connect buyers with sellers. The buyer and seller to agree on the terms of the contract, the price and the timeframe. When the tender process is complete and the contract has been awarded Honest Day\'s Work involvement in the process is complete and the completion of the contract is then between the buyer and the seller.</p><p> </p><h3>What if circumstances out of my control, such as the weather, mean the contract is delayed?</h3><p>Each scenario will be different; it is up to the parties to consider if the circumstances are covered in the conditions of contract (if part of the contract), or if not if the circumstances represent a fair and reasonable reason for delay. If the parties can not come to an agreement then the Small Claims tribunal is an option for resolution.</p><p> </p><h3>I want to ask a tender question that contains commercially sensitive information - should I do this.</h3><p>You can ask commercially sensitive questions; if the purchaser thinks it is appropriate they will make the question and answer only viewable to you. If you are concerned that the information is highly sensitive then it is best not to disclose it.</p><p> </p><h3>What if you disagree with feedback that has been submitted against your account?</h3><p>In the case of feedback being given which you disagree with Honest Day\'s work will assess the nature of the feedback provided by both parties and make a decision regarding weather the feedback is warranted or should be modified/removed. We undertake to make a fair and consistent decision on feedback; if either party remains unhappy we can review the facts and reconsider our decision. Where disagreement remains between the buyer and the seller it may be appropriate for the parties to take the dispute to the small claims tribunal.</p><p> </p><h3>What is the difference between and Open Tender and a Closed Tender?</h3><p>An open tender is one that is visible to all users and for which tenders can be submitted by all users. A closed tender is one where the purchaser invites specific users to price the work. Invited tenders are suitable for work that is highly specialised and the potential tenderers are well known, or for work where the purchasers experience/knowledge determines that the best value for money and quality is only provided through certain tenderers. A closed tender will not appear on searches.</p><p> </p><h3>How do I pay for setting up or submitting a tender?</h3><p>There are two options. PayPal accepts all major credit cards. POLI is a system where you can log into your bank with the Honest Day\'s Work environment and make a direct debit payment. Both of these systems are secure. We do not retain credit card details; the payments are handled entirely by PayPal and POLI. POLI supports direct debits with the following banks ANZ, ASB, BankDirect, Bank of New Zealand, Kiwibank, TSB Bank and Westpac and is used by other large organisations such as NZTA, Bunnings and the Wharehouse.

If you are preparing a tender, read the information below. If you are submitting a tender, click <a title=\"Resources for Submitting Tenders\" href=\"[sitetree_link,id=17]\">here</a>.</p><p> </p><p>When preparing tender documentation it is important to understand the level of risk you are comfortable with. For example if you are setting up a tender for the construction of a fence, and you believe the cost is around $1,000, you may be comfortable with specifying all your requirements through photos, a sketch and a description of the work. If a dispute arose around some aspect of the work then this could be dealt with by negotiation or in the Small Claims Tribunal and the cost at stake may be manageable.</p><p> </p><p>If the tender being set up was for the construction of a house then the level of risk would be significantly higher and it would be necessary to have drawings and tender documentation prepared to ensure both parties understood what was required, when payments would be made, what would happen if the work was delayed etc. The investment in time/cost to prepare the documents would be worthwhile considering the risk being managed.</p><p> </p><p>Below are templates and guidance on common aspects of tendering. If you are not sure if you need these documents or not it is always best to consult a professional.</p><p> </p><h2>Drawings/Sketches</h2><p>A simple job such as a fence may just require a sketch showing the location, length, height, foundations etc. Larger jobs will often require pages of detailed drawings showing precise measurements and critical features of the work.</p><p> </p><h2>Conditions of Tendering</h2><p>Conditions of Tendering describe the rules of the tendering and tender assessment process. This ensures that both Tenderers and the Client understand what information needs to be provided with the Tender and the process the Client will go through to assess and award the contract.</p><p> </p><h2>Standard Conditions</h2><p>Standard Conditions is a document which sets out the rules and method of managing a contract. Common standards used in New Zealand are:</p><p>· <a title=\"NZS 3910:2013\" href=\"https://shop.standards.govt.nz/catalog/3910%3A2013%28NZS%29/view\">NZS 3910:2013</a> - Construction (link is to the scope only)</p><p>· <a title=\"NZS 3916:2013\" href=\"https://shop.standards.govt.nz/catalog/3916%3A2013%28NZS%29/view?client=html5\">NZS 3916:2013</a> - Design and Construct (link is to the scope only)</p><p>· <a title=\"NZS 3917:2013\" href=\"https://shop.standards.govt.nz/catalog/3917%3A2013%28NZS%29/view\">NZS 3917:2013</a> - Fixed Term (link is to the scope only)</p><p>Other standards are also available.</p><p> </p><h2>Special Conditions</h2><p>Special conditions modify the standard conditions so that the conditions better suit the needs/complexities of your own project. The special conditions are drafted up on a case by case basis.</p><p> </p><h2>Estimate</h2><p>For some jobs, particularly large and complex work, it is helpful to provide an estimate for the Tenderers. Normally this is prepared by an Engineer or someone who has a good understanding of the work. This will help the Tenderers quickly gauge the scope of the work and your expectations around the cost.</p><p> </p><h2>Schedule of Prices</h2><p>A schedule of prices is a breakdown of the price structure line by line. It provides the Tenderers with a format for breaking down their price which makes it easy to compare particular items between Tenders submitted. Once the job is awarded the schedule then provides a means of recording and claiming costs as the work is progressively completed. Essential for complex jobs.</p><p> </p><h2>Terms/Basis of Payment</h2><p>Terms of Payment (or Basis of Payment), describes how and when payments will be made. This is important for work which may span several months, is high risk or has more than one or two elements. Usually the Terms of Payment will refer directly to the schedule of prices and describe how each line item will be paid.</p><p> </p><h2>Specification</h2><p>A specification is a written document which describes the requirements of the work. This could be a short document for simple work or a larger document for more complex work. Normally it would contain sections which align with the schedule of prices and the drawings. Often the specification will refer to well known standards, ensuring the work is completed to best practice. Essential for complex work.</p><p> </p><h2>Extra Reading</h2><p>The New Zealand government have rules for government agency procurement and tendering. While these may be a lot to read through and more onerous than what is required for your job, they do contain some good principals that will help you understand the process.

The client may not select the lowest price if it is evident that that tenderer did not understand critical elements of the job. Use the forum in the tender to ask the client questions about the job, particularly if you can see risks or it is evident the client is unsure about the job.</p><p> </p><p>Each tender will require different supporting information, check well in advance of the tender close date what is required to be submitted and ensure you have enough time to prepare the documentation.

Note that when you submit the tender you are required to confirm that you have read and understood all the information provided by the purchaser.</p><p> </p><h3>What if the price submitted differs from the schedule of prices (if submitted)?</h3><p>The total price submitted takes precedence over the schedule of prices. The purchaser and seller will have to negotiate changes to the schedule of prices so that it matches the total price.</p><p> </p><h3>When I assess the tenders do I need to accept the lowest price?</h3><p>If the tender is a simple one with no terms and conditions then you are to use your own judgement to assess which tender provides the best fit for the services you require. If the tender is more complex, with conditions of tendering as part of the tender docmentation, you are bound to assess the tenders according to the conditions of tendering.</p><p> </p><h3>What protection does Honest Day\'s Work offer buyers?</h3><p>Honest Day\'s Work provides a service to connect buyers with sellers. The buyer and seller to agree on the terms of the contract, the price and the timeframe. When the tender process is complete and the contract has been awarded Honest Day\'s Work involvement in the process is complete and the completion of the contract is then between the buyer and the seller.</p><p> </p><h3>What if circumstances out of my control, such as the weather, mean the contract is delayed?</h3><p>Each scenario will be different; it is up to the parties to consider if the circumstances are covered in the conditions of contract (if part of the contract), or if not if the circumstances represent a fair and reasonable reason for delay. If the parties can not come to an agreement then the Small Claims tribunal is an option for resolution.</p><p> </p><h3>I want to ask a tender question that contains commercially sensitive information - should I do this.</h3><p>You can ask commercially sensitive questions; if the purchaser thinks it is appropriate they will make the question and answer only viewable to you. If you are concerned that the information is highly sensitive then it is best not to disclose it.</p><p> </p><h3>What if you disagree with feedback that has been submitted against your account?</h3><p>In the case of feedback being given which you disagree with Honest Day\'s work will assess the nature of the feedback provided by both parties and make a decision regarding weather the feedback is warranted or should be modified/removed. We undertake to make a fair and consistent decision on feedback; if either party remains unhappy we can review the facts and reconsider our decision. Where disagreement remains between the buyer and the seller it may be appropriate for the parties to take the dispute to the small claims tribunal.</p><p> </p><h3>What is the difference between and Open Tender and a Closed Tender?</h3><p>An open tender is one that is visible to all users and for which tenders can be submitted by all users. A closed tender is one where the purchaser invites specific users to price the work. Invited tenders are suitable for work that is highly specialised and the potential tenderers are well known, or for work where the purchasers experience/knowledge determines that the best value for money and quality is only provided through certain tenderers. A closed tender will not appear on searches.</p><p> </p><h3>How do I pay for setting up or submitting a tender?</h3><p>There are two options. PayPal accepts all major credit cards. POLI is a system where you can log into your bank with the Honest Day\'s Work environment and make a direct debit payment. Both of these systems are secure. We do not retain credit card details; the payments are handled entirely by PayPal and POLI.

Upload enough photos to clearly show all facets of the job, the surrounding environment, access points and sensitive areas (eg. your favourite tree which you don\'t want cut down). Note that we limit the size of the photos to a maximum of 2Mb each; you may need to lower the resolution of your camera to ensure the photos are below this limit.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to upload a sketch or plan?</h3><p>This depends entirely on the job. A tender for a job to clean a building would normally not require a sketch or plan. A tender for a tree removal would be made clearer with a sketch showing where the cut branches are to be stacked. A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work. A video is valuable to communicate to the tenderers the scale of the project, describe some of the aspects of the project that are difficult to communicate in words and provide an idea of the surrounding environment. Ensure video file sizes are kept to a minimum to assist with upload and download speeds.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to include contract documents when I set up the tender?</h3><p>This depends on the level of complexity of the project and the value of the work. If the tender is to paint a fence then contract documents would be unlikely to be needed; the contract would be based on the detail provided in the description, the photos provided, the price and any other details provided in the Question and Answers. If the tender is to build a house then it would be usual to include a full package of documents with the tender, such as drawings, specifications, terms of payment, conditions etc.</p><p> </p><h3>What information do I need to provide when I submit my price?</h3><p>This depends on what the purchaser requires. As a minimum you will need to submit a price only. Other information that may be required by the purchaser includes clarifications and notes, schedule of prices, sketches/designs and other documents as required by the purchaser. Note that when you submit the tender you are required to confirm that you have read and understood all the information provided by the purchaser.</p><p> </p><h3>What if the price submitted differs from the schedule of prices (if submitted)?</h3><p>The total price submitted takes precedence over the schedule of prices. The purchaser and seller will have to negotiate changes to the schedule of prices so that it matches the total price.</p><p> </p><h3>When I assess the tenders do I need to accept the lowest price?</h3><p>If the tender is a simple one with no terms and conditions then you are to use your own judgement to assess which tender provides the best fit for the services you require. If the tender is more complex, with conditions of tendering as part of the tender docmentation, you are bound to assess the tenders according to the conditions of tendering.</p><p> </p><h3>What protection does Honest Day\'s Work offer buyers?</h3><p>Honest Day\'s Work provides a service to connect buyers with sellers. The buyer and seller to agree on the terms of the contract, the price and the timeframe. When the tender process is complete and the contract has been awarded Honest Day\'s Work involvement in the process is complete and the completion of the contract is then between the buyer and the seller.</p><p> </p><h3>What if circumstances out of my control, such as the weather, mean the contract is delayed?</h3><p>Each scenario will be different; it is up to the parties to consider if the circumstances are covered in the conditions of contract (if part of the contract), or if not if the circumstances represent a fair and reasonable reason for delay. If the parties can not come to an agreement then the Small Claims tribunal is an option for resolution.</p><p> </p><h3>I want to ask a tender question that contains commercially sensitive information - should I do this.</h3><p>You can ask commercially sensitive questions; if the purchaser thinks it is appropriate they will make the question and answer only viewable to you. If you are concerned that the information is highly sensitive then it is best not to disclose it.</p><p> </p><h3>What if you disagree with feedback that has been submitted against your account?</h3><p>In the case of feedback being given which you disagree with Honest Day\'s work will assess the nature of the feedback provided by both parties and make a decision regarding weather the feedback is warranted or should be modified/removed. We undertake to make a fair and consistent decision on feedback; if either party remains unhappy we can review the facts and reconsider our decision. Where disagreement remains between the buyer and the seller it may be appropriate for the parties to take the dispute to the small claims tribunal.</p><p> </p><h3>What is the difference between and Open Tender and a Closed Tender?</h3><p>An open tender is one that is visible to all users and for which tenders can be submitted by all users. A closed tender is one where the purchaser invites specific users to price the work. Invited tenders are suitable for work that is highly specialised and the potential tenderers are well known, or for work where the purchasers experience/knowledge determines that the best value for money and quality is only provided through certain tenderers. A closed tender will not appear on searches.</p><p> </p><h3>How do I pay for setting up or submitting a tender?</h3><p>There are two options. PayPal accepts all major credit cards.

In light of this our pricing structure is built for maximum efficiency, we\'re sure you\'ll like it:</p><p><strong>Creating a Tender</strong></p><p> - For simple tenders - Free (see below for a description of simple tenders)</p><p> - For complex tenders - $1 per feature up to a maximum of $8.</p><p>     The list of possible features is:</p><p>      - Estimate</p><p>      - Schedule of Prices</p><p>      - Specifications</p><p>      - Drawings/Sketch</p><p>      - Terms of Payment</p><p>      - Standard Conditions</p><p>      - Special Conditions</p><p>      - Conditions of Tendering</p><p> </p><p>Submitting a Tender</p><p> - For simple tenders - $1 per submission</p><p> - For complex tenders - $1 per feature uploaded during setup. The cost will be the same as the setup cost.</p><h3>What is a \'Simple Tender\'?</h3><p>For jobs that don\'t have a detailed specification document, schedule of prices or detailed drawings etc. If all you\'ve got is a photo, a description of what you want and possibly a video, then the \'Simple Tender\' is for you. We\'ve made it as easy as possible for you to upload your job and get the tender underway - and it\'s free!</p><p> </p><h3>How many photos should I upload?</h3><p>Photos are valuable for the tenderers pricing the work. Upload enough photos to clearly show all facets of the job, the surrounding environment, access points and sensitive areas (eg. your favourite tree which you don\'t want cut down). Note that we limit the size of the photos to a maximum of 2Mb each; you may need to lower the resolution of your camera to ensure the photos are below this limit.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to upload a sketch or plan?</h3><p>This depends entirely on the job.

A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work. A video is valuable to communicate to the tenderers the scale of the project, describe some of the aspects of the project that are difficult to communicate in words and provide an idea of the surrounding environment. Ensure video file sizes are kept to a minimum to assist with upload and download speeds.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to include contract documents when I set up the tender?</h3><p>This depends on the level of complexity of the project and the value of the work. If the tender is to paint a fence then contract documents would be unlikely to be needed; the contract would be based on the detail provided in the description, the photos provided, the price and any other details provided in the Question and Answers.

We\'ve made it as easy as possible for you to upload your job and get the tender underway - and it\'s free!</p><p> </p><h3>How many photos should I upload?</h3><p>Photos are valuable for the tenderers pricing the work. Upload enough photos to clearly show all facets of the job, the surrounding environment, access points and sensitive areas (eg. your favourite tree which you don\'t want cut down).

A tender for a job to clean a building would normally not require a sketch or plan. A tender for a tree removal would be made clearer with a sketch showing where the cut branches are to be stacked. A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work.

If the tender is to paint a fence then contract documents would be unlikely to be needed; the contract would be based on the detail provided in the description, the photos provided, the price and any other details provided in the Question and Answers.

We\'re sure you\'ll like it.</p><p> </p><h3>What is a \'Simple Tender\'?</h3><p>For jobs that don\'t have a detailed specification document, schedule of prices or detailed drawings etc. If all you\'ve got is a photo, a description of what you want and possibly a video, then the \'Simple Tender\' is for you. We\'ve made it as easy as possible for you to upload your job and get the tender underway - and it\'s free!</p><p> </p><h3>How many photos should I upload?</h3><p>Photos are valuable for the tenderers pricing the work. Upload enough photos to clearly show all facets of the job, the surrounding environment, access points and sensitive areas (eg. your favourite tree which you don\'t want cut down). Note that we limit the size of the photos to a maximum of 2Mb each; you may need to lower the resolution of your camera to ensure the photos are below this limit.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to upload a sketch or plan?</h3><p>This depends entirely on the job. A tender for a job to clean a building would normally not require a sketch or plan. A tender for a tree removal would be made clearer with a sketch showing where the cut branches are to be stacked. A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work. A video is valuable to communicate to the tenderers the scale of the project, describe some of the aspects of the project that are difficult to communicate in words and provide an idea of the surrounding environment. Ensure video file sizes are kept to a minimum to assist with upload and download speeds.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to include contract documents when I set up the tender?</h3><p>This depends on the level of complexity of the project and the value of the work. If the tender is to paint a fence then contract documents would be unlikely to be needed; the contract would be based on the detail provided in the description, the photos provided, the price and any other details provided in the Question and Answers. If the tender is to build a house then it would be usual to include a full package of documents with the tender, such as drawings, specifications, terms of payment, conditions etc.</p><p> </p><h3>What information do I need to provide when I submit my price?</h3><p>This depends on what the purchaser requires. As a minimum you will need to submit a price only. Other information that may be required by the purchaser includes clarifications and notes, schedule of prices, sketches/designs and other documents as required by the purchaser. Note that when you submit the tender you are required to confirm that you have read and understood all the information provided by the purchaser.</p><p> </p><h3>What if the price submitted differs from the schedule of prices (if submitted)?</h3><p>The total price submitted takes precedence over the schedule of prices. The purchaser and seller will have to negotiate changes to the schedule of prices so that it matches the total price.</p><p> </p><h3>When I assess the tenders do I need to accept the lowest price?</h3><p>If the tender is a simple one with no terms and conditions then you are to use your own judgement to assess which tender provides the best fit for the services you require.

Use the forum in the tender to ask the client questions about the job, particularly if you can see risks or it is evident the client is unsure about the job.</p><p> </p><p>Each tender will require different supporting information, check well in advance of the tender close date what is required to be submitted and ensure you have enough time to prepare the documentation. If the client hasn\'t provided enough time to prepare the necessary documentation, ask them why - it may be that they don\'t understand how much time you need to prepare the submission and they may choose to extend the submission date.</p><p> </p><p>Some external websites for further reading:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.procurement.govt.nz/procurement/for-suppliers/resources-for-responding-to-government-tenders/hints-for-tendering\">Hints for Tendering</a></p><p><a title=\"Tendering Handbook\" href=\"http://industryadvocate.sa.gov.au/upload/industry-advocate/resources-downloads/tender-ready-handbook.pdf?t=1505174400023\">Tendering Handbook</a> (South Australia)</p><p><a title=\"How to Lose Tenders\" href=\"http://www.plana.co.nz/how-lose-tenders\">How to Lose Tenders</a></p><p> </p>', NULL, NULL, 0, 1, 16, 0, 0, NULL, 'Inherit', 'Inherit', 0),

If you are not sure if you need these documents or not it is always best to consult a professional.</p><p> </p><h2>Drawings/Sketches</h2><p>A simple job such as a fence may just require a sketch showing the location, length, height, foundations etc. Larger jobs will often require pages of detailed drawings showing precise measurements and critical features of the work.</p><p> </p><h2>Conditions of Tendering</h2><p>Conditions of Tendering describe the rules of the tendering and tender assessment process. This ensures that both Tenderers and the Client understand what information needs to be provided with the Tender and the process the Client will go through to assess and award the contract.</p><p> </p><h2>Standard Conditions</h2><p>Standard Conditions is a document which sets out the rules and method of managing a contract. Common standards used in New Zealand are:</p><p>· <a title=\"NZS 3910:2013\" href=\"https://shop.standards.govt.nz/catalog/3910%3A2013%28NZS%29/view\">NZS 3910:2013</a> - Construction (link is to the scope only)</p><p>· <a title=\"NZS 3916:2013\" href=\"https://shop.standards.govt.nz/catalog/3916%3A2013%28NZS%29/view?client=html5\">NZS 3916:2013</a> - Design and Construct (link is to the scope only)</p><p>· <a title=\"NZS 3917:2013\" href=\"https://shop.standards.govt.nz/catalog/3917%3A2013%28NZS%29/view\">NZS 3917:2013</a> - Fixed Term (link is to the scope only)</p><p>Other standards are also available.</p><p> </p><h2>Special Conditions</h2><p>Special conditions modify the standard conditions so that the conditions better suit the needs/complexities of your own project. The special conditions are drafted up on a case by case basis.</p><p> </p><h2>Estimate</h2><p>For some jobs, particularly large and complex work, it is helpful to provide an estimate for the Tenderers. Normally this is prepared by an Engineer or someone who has a good understanding of the work. This will help the Tenderers quickly gauge the scope of the work and your expectations around the cost.</p><p>The estimate should include GST.</p><p> </p><h2>Schedule of Prices</h2><p>A schedule of prices is a breakdown of the price structure line by line. It provides the Tenderers with a format for breaking down their price which makes it easy to compare particular items between Tenders submitted. Once the job is awarded the schedule then provides a means of recording and claiming costs as the work is progressively completed. Essential for complex jobs.</p><p> </p><h2>Terms/Basis of Payment</h2><p>Terms of Payment (or Basis of Payment), describes how and when payments will be made. This is important for work which may span several months, is high risk or has more than one or two elements. Usually the Terms of Payment will refer directly to the schedule of prices and describe how each line item will be paid.</p><p> </p><h2>Specification</h2><p>A specification is a written document which describes the requirements of the work. This could be a short document for simple work or a larger document for more complex work. Normally it would contain sections which align with the schedule of prices and the drawings. Often the specification will refer to well known standards, ensuring the work is completed to best practice. Essential for complex work.</p><p> </p><h2>Extra Reading</h2><p>The New Zealand government have rules for government agency procurement and tendering.

We\'ve made it as easy as possible for you to upload your job and get the tender underway - and it\'s free!</p><p> </p><h3>How many photos should I upload?</h3><p>Photos are valuable for the tenderers pricing the work. Upload enough photos to clearly show all facets of the job, the surrounding environment, access points and sensitive areas (eg. your favourite tree which you don\'t want cut down). Note that we limit the size of the photos to a maximum of 2Mb each; you may need to lower the resolution of your camera to ensure the photos are below this limit.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to upload a sketch or plan?</h3><p>This depends entirely on the job. A tender for a job to clean a building would normally not require a sketch or plan. A tender for a tree removal would be made clearer with a sketch showing where the cut branches are to be stacked. A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work. A video is valuable to communicate to the tenderers the scale of the project, describe some of the aspects of the project that are difficult to communicate in words and provide an idea of the surrounding environment. Ensure video file sizes are kept to a minimum to assist with upload and download speeds.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to include contract documents when I set up the tender?</h3><p>This depends on the level of complexity of the project and the value of the work. If the tender is to paint a fence then contract documents would be unlikely to be needed; the contract would be based on the detail provided in the description, the photos provided, the price and any other details provided in the Question and Answers. If the tender is to build a house then it would be usual to include a full package of documents with the tender, such as drawings, specifications, terms of payment, conditions etc.</p><p> </p><h3>What information do I need to provide when I submit my price?</h3><p>This depends on what the purchaser requires. As a minimum you will need to submit a price only. Other information that may be required by the purchaser includes clarifications and notes, schedule of prices, sketches/designs and other documents as required by the purchaser.

A closed tender is one where the purchaser invites specific users to price the work.

We\'ve made it as easy as possible for you to upload your job and get the tender underway - and it\'s free!</p><p> </p><h3>How many photos should I upload?</h3><p>Photos are valuable for the tenderers pricing the work. Upload enough photos to clearly show all facets of the job, the surrounding environment, access points and sensitive areas (eg. your favourite tree which you don\'t want cut down). Note that we limit the size of the photos to a maximum of 2Mb each; you may need to lower the resolution of your camera to ensure the photos are below this limit.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to upload a sketch or plan?</h3><p>This depends entirely on the job. A tender for a job to clean a building would normally not require a sketch or plan. A tender for a tree removal would be made clearer with a sketch showing where the cut branches are to be stacked. A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work. A video is valuable to communicate to the tenderers the scale of the project, describe some of the aspects of the project that are difficult to communicate in words and provide an idea of the surrounding environment. Ensure video file sizes are kept to a minimum to assist with upload and download speeds.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to include contract documents when I set up the tender?</h3><p>This depends on the level of complexity of the project and the value of the work. If the tender is to paint a fence then contract documents would be unlikely to be needed; the contract would be based on the detail provided in the description, the photos provided, the price and any other details provided in the Question and Answers. If the tender is to build a house then it would be usual to include a full package of documents with the tender, such as drawings, specifications, terms of payment, conditions etc.</p><p> </p><h3>What information do I need to provide when I submit my price?</h3><p>This depends on what the purchaser requires.

We\'ve made it as easy as possible for you to upload your job and get the tender underway - and it\'s free!</p><p> </p><h3>How many photos should I upload?</h3><p>Photos are valuable for the tenderers pricing the work. Upload enough photos to clearly show all facets of the job, the surrounding environment, access points and sensitive areas (eg. your favourite tree which you don\'t want cut down). Note that we limit the size of the photos to a maximum of 2Mb each; you may need to lower the resolution of your camera to ensure the photos are below this limit.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to upload a sketch or plan?</h3><p>This depends entirely on the job. A tender for a job to clean a building would normally not require a sketch or plan. A tender for a tree removal would be made clearer with a sketch showing where the cut branches are to be stacked. A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work. A video is valuable to communicate to the tenderers the scale of the project, describe some of the aspects of the project that are difficult to communicate in words and provide an idea of the surrounding environment. Ensure video file sizes are kept to a minimum to assist with upload and download speeds.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to include contract documents when I set up the tender?</h3><p>This depends on the level of complexity of the project and the value of the work. If the tender is to paint a fence then contract documents would be unlikely to be needed; the contract would be based on the detail provided in the description, the photos provided, the price and any other details provided in the Question and Answers. If the tender is to build a house then it would be usual to include a full package of documents with the tender, such as drawings, specifications, terms of payment, conditions etc.</p><p> </p><h3>What information do I need to provide when I submit my price?</h3><p>This depends on what the purchaser requires. As a minimum you will need to submit a price only. Other information that may be required by the purchaser includes clarifications and notes, schedule of prices, sketches/designs and other documents as required by the purchaser. Note that when you submit the tender you are required to confirm that you have read and understood all the information provided by the purchaser.</p><p> </p><h3>What if the price submitted differs from the schedule of prices (if submitted)?</h3><p>The total price submitted takes precedence over the schedule of prices. The purchaser and seller will have to negotiate changes to the schedule of prices so that it matches the total price.</p><p> </p><h3>When I assess the tenders do I need to accept the lowest price?</h3><p>If the tender is a simple one with no terms and conditions then you are to use your own judgement to assess which tender provides the best fit for the services you require. If the tender is more complex, with conditions of tendering as part of the tender docmentation, you are bound to assess the tenders according to the conditions of tendering.</p><p> </p><h3>What protection does Honest Day\'s Work offer buyers?</h3><p>Honest Day\'s Work provides a service to connect buyers with sellers. The buyer and seller to agree on the terms of the contract, the price and the timeframe. When the tender process is complete and the contract has been awarded Honest Day\'s Work involvement in the process is complete and the completion of the contract is then between the buyer and the seller.</p><p> </p><h3>What if circumstances out of my control, such as the weather, mean the contract is delayed?</h3><p>Each scenario will be different; it is up to the parties to consider if the circumstances are covered in the conditions of contract (if part of the contract), or if not if the circumstances represent a fair and reasonable reason for delay. If the parties can not come to an agreement then the Small Claims tribunal is an option for resolution.</p><p> </p><h3>I want to ask a tender question that contains commercially sensitive information - should I do this.</h3><p>You can ask commercially sensitive questions; if the purchaser thinks it is appropriate they will make the question and answer only viewable to you. If you are concerned that the information is highly sensitive then it is best not to disclose it.</p><p> </p><h3>What if you disagree with feedback that has been submitted against your account?</h3><p>In the case of feedback being given which you disagree with Honest Day\'s work will assess the nature of the feedback provided by both parties and make a decision regarding weather the feedback is warranted or should be modified/removed. We undertake to make a fair and consistent decision on feedback; if either party remains unhappy we can review the facts and reconsider our decision. Where disagreement remains between the buyer and the seller it may be appropriate for the parties to take the dispute to the small claims tribunal.</p><p> </p><h3>What is the difference between and Open Tender and a Closed Tender?</h3><p>An open tender is one that is visible to all users and for which tenders can be submitted by all users. A closed tender is one where the purchaser invites specific users to price the work. Invited tenders are suitable for work that is highly specialised and the potential tenderers are well known, or for work where the purchasers experience/knowledge determines that the best value for money and quality is only provided through certain tenderers.

A tender for a job to clean a building would normally not require a sketch or plan. A tender for a tree removal would be made clearer with a sketch showing where the cut branches are to be stacked. A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work.

A tender for a job to clean a building would normally not require a sketch or plan. A tender for a tree removal would be made clearer with a sketch showing where the cut branches are to be stacked. A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work.

We\'ve made it as easy as possible for you to upload your job and get the tender underway - and it\'s free!</p><p> </p><h3>How many photos should I upload?</h3><p>Photos are valuable for the tenderers pricing the work. Upload enough photos to clearly show all facets of the job, the surrounding environment, access points and sensitive areas (eg. your favourite tree which you don\'t want cut down). Note that we limit the size of the photos to a maximum of 2Mb each; you may need to lower the resolution of your camera to ensure the photos are below this limit.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to upload a sketch or plan?</h3><p>This depends entirely on the job. A tender for a job to clean a building would normally not require a sketch or plan. A tender for a tree removal would be made clearer with a sketch showing where the cut branches are to be stacked. A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work.

As a minimum you will need to submit a price only.

Note that when you submit the tender you are required to confirm that you have read and understood all the information provided by the purchaser.</p><p> </p><h3>What if the price submitted differs from the schedule of prices (if submitted)?</h3><p>The total price submitted takes precedence over the schedule of prices.

If the tender is more complex, with conditions of tendering as part of the tender docmentation, you are bound to assess the tenders according to the conditions of tendering.</p><p> </p><h3>What protection does Honest Day\'s Work offer buyers?</h3><p>Honest Day\'s Work provides a service to connect buyers with sellers.

If the parties can not come to an agreement then the Small Claims tribunal is an option for resolution.</p><p> </p><h3>I want to ask a tender question that contains commercially sensitive information - should I do this.</h3><p>You can ask commercially sensitive questions; if the purchaser thinks it is appropriate they will make the question and answer only viewable to you.

As a minimum you will need to submit a price only. Other information that may be required by the purchaser includes clarifications and notes, schedule of prices, sketches/designs and other documents as required by the purchaser. Note that when you submit the tender you are required to confirm that you have read and understood all the information provided by the purchaser.</p><p> </p><h3>What if the price submitted differs from the schedule of prices (if submitted)?</h3><p>The total price submitted takes precedence over the schedule of prices.

We\'ve made it as easy as possible for you to upload your job and get the tender underway - and it\'s free!</p><p> </p><h3>How many photos should I upload?</h3><p>Photos are valuable for the tenderers pricing the work. Upload enough photos to clearly show all facets of the job, the surrounding environment, access points and sensitive areas (eg. your favourite tree which you don\'t want cut down). Note that we limit the size of the photos to a maximum of 2Mb each; you may need to lower the resolution of your camera to ensure the photos are below this limit.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to upload a sketch or plan?</h3><p>This depends entirely on the job. A tender for a job to clean a building would normally not require a sketch or plan. A tender for a tree removal would be made clearer with a sketch showing where the cut branches are to be stacked. A tender for the construction of a shed would need a clear plan and a tender for the construction of a house would need several sheets of detailed design plans.</p><p> </p><h3>Should I upload a video?</h3><p>This depends on the scale of the work. A video is valuable to communicate to the tenderers the scale of the project, describe some of the aspects of the project that are difficult to communicate in words and provide an idea of the surrounding environment. Ensure video file sizes are kept to a minimum to assist with upload and download speeds.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need to include contract documents when I set up the tender?</h3><p>This depends on the level of complexity of the project and the value of the work. If the tender is to paint a fence then contract documents would be unlikely to be needed; the contract would be based on the detail provided in the description, the photos provided, the price and any other details provided in the Question and Answers. If the tender is to build a house then it would be usual to include a full package of documents with the tender, such as drawings, specifications, terms of payment, conditions etc.</p><p> </p><h3>What information do I need to provide when I submit my price?</h3><p>This depends on what the purchaser requires. As a minimum you will need to submit a price only. Other information that may be required by the purchaser includes clarifications and notes, schedule of prices, sketches/designs and other documents as required by the purchaser. Note that when you submit the tender you are required to confirm that you have read and understood all the information provided by the purchaser.</p><p> </p><h3>What if the price submitted differs from the schedule of prices (if submitted)?</h3><p>The total price submitted takes precedence over the schedule of prices. The purchaser and seller will have to negotiate changes to the schedule of prices so that it matches the total price.</p><p> </p><h3>When I assess the tenders do I need to accept the lowest price?</h3><p>If the tender is a simple one with no terms and conditions then you are to use your own judgement to assess which tender provides the best fit for the services you require. If the tender is more complex, with conditions of tendering as part of the tender docmentation, you are bound to assess the tenders according to the conditions of tendering.</p><p> </p><h3>What protection does Honest Day\'s Work offer buyers?</h3><p>Honest Day\'s Work provides a service to connect buyers with sellers. The buyer and seller to agree on the terms of the contract, the price and the timeframe.

If the parties can not come to an agreement then the Small Claims tribunal is an option for resolution.</p><p> </p><h3>I want to ask a tender question that contains commercially sensitive information - should I do this.</h3><p>You can ask commercially sensitive questions; if the purchaser thinks it is appropriate they will make the question and answer only viewable to you. If you are concerned that the information is highly sensitive then it is best not to disclose it.</p><p> </p><h3>What if you disagree with feedback that has been submitted against your account?</h3><p>In the case of feedback being given which you disagree with Honest Day\'s work will assess the nature of the feedback provided by both parties and make a decision regarding weather the feedback is warranted or should be modified/removed.

Where disagreement remains between the buyer and the seller it may be appropriate for the parties to take the dispute to the small claims tribunal.</p><p> </p><h3>What is the difference between and Open Tender and a Closed Tender?</h3><p>An open tender is one that is visible to all users and for which tenders can be submitted by all users. A closed tender is one where the purchaser invites specific users to price the work. Invited tenders are suitable for work that is highly specialised and the potential tenderers are well known, or for work where the purchasers experience/knowledge determines that the best value for money and quality is only provided through certain tenderers.

If you are not sure if you need these documents or not it is always best to consult a professional.</p><p> </p><h2>Drawings/Sketches</h2><p>A simple job such as a fence may just require a sketch showing the location, length, height, foundations etc. Larger jobs will often require pages of detailed drawings showing precise measurements and critical features of the work.</p><p> </p><h2>Conditions of Tendering</h2><p>Conditions of Tendering describe the rules of the tendering and tender assessment process. This ensures that both Tenderers and the Client understand what information needs to be provided with the Tender and the process the Client will go through to assess and award the contract.</p><p> </p><h2>Standard Conditions</h2><p>Standard Conditions is a document which sets out the rules and method of managing a contract. Common standards used in New Zealand are:</p><p>· <a title=\"NZS 3910:2013\" href=\"https://shop.standards.govt.nz/catalog/3910%3A2013%28NZS%29/view\">NZS 3910:2013</a> - Construction (link is to the scope only)</p><p>· <a title=\"NZS 3916:2013\" href=\"https://shop.standards.govt.nz/catalog/3916%3A2013%28NZS%29/view?client=html5\">NZS 3916:2013</a> - Design and Construct (link is to the scope only)</p><p>· <a title=\"NZS 3917:2013\" href=\"https://shop.standards.govt.nz/catalog/3917%3A2013%28NZS%29/view\">NZS 3917:2013</a> - Fixed Term (link is to the scope only)</p><p>Other standards are also available.</p><p> </p><h2>Special Conditions</h2><p>Special conditions modify the standard conditions so that the conditions better suit the needs/complexities of your own project. The special conditions are drafted up on a case by case basis.</p><p> </p><h2>Estimate</h2><p>For some jobs, particularly large and complex work, it is helpful to provide an estimate for the Tenderers. Normally this is prepared by an Engineer or someone who has a good understanding of the work. This will help the Tenderers quickly gauge the scope of the work and your expectations around the cost.</p><p> </p><h2>Schedule of Prices</h2><p>A schedule of prices is a breakdown of the price structure line by line. It provides the Tenderers with a format for breaking down their price which makes it easy to compare particular items between Tenders submitted. Once the job is awarded the schedule then provides a means of recording and claiming costs as the work is progressively completed. Essential for complex jobs.</p><p> </p><h2>Terms/Basis of Payment</h2><p>Terms of Payment (or Basis of Payment), describes how and when payments will be made. This is important for work which may span several months, is high risk or has more than one or two elements. Usually the Terms of Payment will refer directly to the schedule of prices and describe how each line item will be paid.</p><p> </p><h2>Specification</h2><p>A specification is a written document which describes the requirements of the work. This could be a short document for simple work or a larger document for more complex work. Normally it would contain sections which align with the schedule of prices and the drawings. Often the specification will refer to well known standards, ensuring the work is completed to best practice. Essential for complex work.</p><p> </p><h2>Extra Reading</h2><p>The New Zealand government have rules for government agency procurement and tendering. While these may be a lot to read through and more onerous than what is required for your job, they do contain some good principals that will help you understand the process.

The client may not select the lowest price if it is evident that that tenderer did not understand critical elements of the job.
